# BATR-FOSS
I decided to make my open-source, just for fun. As I've not touched the game in a while, after gdevelop 5.3 released, I though this was a great way to revive the project.


You can reproduce this game anywhere else, but please, put credit. You also can't say that I MADE the game. You can't put my logo, to be certain. (My logo is the same thing as my profile picture, there are also a couple others. While the "logos" are quirky, you can't put them in your fan-game as a SIGN I did NOT make the game. You free the game's name, though.
